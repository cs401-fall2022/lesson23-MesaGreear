## Instructions

For the **Experience** section you need to detail your experience with this lab. 

- Were there any things that you struggled with? 
- Were there any parts of this lab that were unclear or poorly specified? 
- Were you able to get the entire project done?

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues or bugs that you have in your
code. For example maybe your code crashes randomly and you couldn't figure out why. If your code
doesn't have any issues you can simply write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used** section you must detail any sources you used outside of the textbook or
course website. If you write NONE in this section it is assumed that you didn't use google at all.
Be safe CITE!

## Experience

I thought that for a final project, I was well prepared by what we have done in the course so far
to do the bare minimum to get 100%. What I liked about this final in particular was the amount of
freedom we had in implementing our required features and any bonus features we wanted to add. Getting
to experiment with several different ways to 'improve' your website was the most fun I've had in a
while and helped me to both better understand what we've covered in the course and learn new things
via just looking them up and experimenting. Because of this, I didn't struggle too much on implementing
any of the required features, but spent plenty of time struggling with additional features that I, for
some reason, decided to add. I believe that the entire project is done, I would only be missing
something if I forgot to do it which isn't impossible given my strange inability to fully read instructions.

## Known issues or Bugs

Starting the server with the command `env:DEBUG='myapp:*'; npm start` causes a lot of red text to
appear, yet the server still seems to run normally. So I'm not sure if it's actually causing any
problems.

Supposedly there are some vulnerabilities in my dependencies. Once again this hasn't caused any
issues as far as I can tell, but thought I would mention it here.

## Sources used

This list hopefully encompasses all the outside sources I used for this project, however it isn't
impossible that I will have missed a viable source or two that I used as aid.

If you see any suspicious looking code that doesn't look like it could've been by me at my current
skill level, please let me know and I'll go look at it and cite it if I used a source for it!
