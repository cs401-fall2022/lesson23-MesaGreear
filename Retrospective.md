## Instructions

For the **Experience** section you need to detail your experience with this lab. 

- Were there any things that you struggled with? 
- Were there any parts of this lab that were unclear or poorly specified? 
- Were you able to get the entire project done?

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues or bugs that you have in your
code. For example maybe your code crashes randomly and you couldn't figure out why. If your code
doesn't have any issues you can simply write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used** section you must detail any sources you used outside of the textbook or
course website. If you write NONE in this section it is assumed that you didn't use google at all.
Be safe CITE!

## Sources used

This list hopefully encompasses all the outside sources I used for this project, however it isn't
impossible that I will have missed a viable source or two that I used as aid.

If you see any suspicious looking code that doesn't look like it could've been by me at my current
skill level, please let me know and I'll go look at it and cite it if I used a source for it!
